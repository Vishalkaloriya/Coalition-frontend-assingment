<img src='./images/CT_SkillTest_v3.png' alt=''>



## Description: 

This submission serves as my skills test for the front-end position at [Coalition Technologies](https://coalitiontechnologies.com/). The aim of this assessment is to gauge my ability to transform an Adobe Photoshop file into a static, single-page web application. The main objective is to convert the provided PSD into a responsive single-page website, ensuring the carousel seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes. On mobile devices, the tabs should smoothly transition into an accordion layout to enhance usability.

I've added internal links on the page, 'History' and 'Team,' enabling users to navigate conveniently to their respective sections. Additionally, I've implemented a parallax scrolling effect into the landing hero image for the desktop view.

## Tools Used: 

* [jQuery](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
* [Flickity](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
